**Choose Your Own Adventure**

We've taught you all about NPM, adding functionality, and packaging. You now know the most fundamental core concepts of Electron, from start to finish.

Let's extend that at your table!

On self-contained branches, go find some of your favorite NPM modules and embed them into your app!

Need Some Starter Ideas?
- Fix the app icons (right now it's a cat because it's missing assignments).
  - HINT: Go back into the earlier branch before we yanked out all of the code and see if you can add the necessary functionality back into your new menubar process.
- Experiment with other native Electron functionality!
  - Make a branch that adds Keyboard shortcuts!
  - Make a branch that creates dialog pop-ups!
  - Super advanced: Make a branch that connects to Bluetooth. Then share, because this would be crazy!

- Set up your app to work with outdated node modules! Then try and break your app to use outdated versions and see the results.
